# Dashboard Details
The dashboard aims to provide users information about Kickstarter projects. It displays information of different regions, dividing into continents-specific and country-specific.

The two insights that can be extracted from the dashboard are:
- Descriptive data: the dashboard concentrates on studying the number of projects, the success rate, and the money pledged detailed by location, categories, time
- Forecasting data: the general outlook for the next 3 years from 2021 â€“ 2023 of projects based on given relevant information. 

The dashboard is a combination of maps and charts that are designed to eliminate the complexity of reading a large amount of data. Information in all individual sheets are connected, which allows users to click to filter desirable outputs.  The information will go from general to more detailed as user drill down the data from left to right, from top to bottom. 

The overall design aims to match Kickstarter color scheme, using their two main colors: green and black to keep the consistent aesthetic of the dashboard. 

There are three sections in the dashboard as being illustrated below:

## Section 1: Starting the dashboard with a place of interest
Getting some statical facts might be useful to start. This section lets you choose the location, either by country of continent, to have some general first look about the total number of project. This filtering also affects the next two sections.

## Section 2: From drilling down to project categories to forecasting success
This section contains information to study the number of projects for popular categories and the success/failed rate. A rough success rate prediction is also provided for each selected category.

## Section 3: Wrapping up with a comprehensive outlook for money and success
This final section allows users to understand the vital information about any projects: will they appeal a lot of money? Moreover, by choosing an interested category, a combined line graph shows the current trend and a project trend in money and success for user.
