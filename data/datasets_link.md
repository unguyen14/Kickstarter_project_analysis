Due to the paramount sizes of the datasets, I included a link to get the latest updated data for your convenience.
The zip file contains accumulated data from 2014 until the specified date in the file name. In order to process the multiple csv sheets for the dashboard, I used [this Python script](https://github.com/unguyen14/Kickstarter_project_analysis/blob/b3285177c90ce7482f2580ad387b08bf06358b5e/data/Kickstarter_2020_data_cleaning.ipynb)
to merge and clean data, as well as creating desired columns for future convenience. 

Since the format of the csv files is consistent, the script can be used to update data regularly for the dashboard.
